# GeoMesa manual documentation

This is not the GeoMesa documentation itself, but rather notes on how to build it.

## Setup

The documentation is built using Python's [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/) module.

Installing Sphinx and its dependencies in a Python ``virtualenv``:

    $ virtualenv sphinx && cd sphinx
    $ source bin/activate
    $ pip install sphinx
    $ pip install recommonmark    # needed to parse Markdown files

Alternatively use ``sudo`` with the ``pip`` command to install the packages in the system Python distribution.

    $ sudo pip install sphinx
    $ sudo pip install recommonmark

You also need ``make``.

Optional:  if you want to build the PDF version of the manual, install LaTeX:

    # on Ubuntu
    $ sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-base texlive-latex-recommended texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-recommended

The LaTeX distribution is pretty big, so you can skip it if you're just interested in the HTML docs.

## Building

To build an HTML version of the manual:

    $ make html

To build a PDF version:

    $ make latexpdf

There are a lot of other formats too, type ``make`` to list them. 

The outputted files are written to the ``_build`` directory. 

## About

The root page of the documentation is ``index.rst``. Any static files included 

The files themselves are written in [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) (RST) and have ``*.rst``
extensions. Markdown files are also supported but do not support any of Docutils or Sphinx's special directives
(cross-references, admonitions, variable substitution, etc.).

For the most part, the syntax of RST is pretty similar to Markdown. Two particular sticking points are links and
code blocks. Inline links should be written like this:
```
`Link text <http://example.com/>`_
```
The final underscore is important!

Code blocks should always be indented with 4 spaces, and prefixed with the `.. code-block:: language` directive:
```
.. code-block:: scala

    val ds = new DataStore()
```

To include an image, copy it into ``_static/img`` and use the following:
```
.. image:: _static/img/name-of-file
```
You can also specify options for how to use the
